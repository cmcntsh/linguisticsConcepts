## Features of language
* duality of patterning - language exists at 2 levels
  * form (individual sounds)
  * signs - combinations of forms (sounds put together to make a word with meaning)
* arbitrariness of the sign
  * distinguish a language from other forms of communication
  * sign - anything that conveys a meaning beyond itself
  * sign can be anything, not necessarily to have specific sound to represent something
  * smell of moisture is a non-arbitrary sign because it is so strongly connected with rain
* displacement
  * past, future, other settings
* reflexivity
  * use language to talk about language
  * meta language
  
## Areas of linguistics
* Phonetics - individual sounds
* Phonology - study of how sounds are combined into patterns
* Morphology - study of internal structure of words
* Syntax - study of how words group together to make sentences
* Semantics - study of meanings of words and sentences
* Pragmatics - meaning in a larger social context
* specific areas
  * sociolinguistics
  * historical linguistics
  * psycholinguistics

## Morphology - what is a word?
  * predictability
* phrase that has meaning not necessarily clear from looking at definitions of parts alone
* meaning is unpredictable
* lexemes or lexical items - entry or unit - largest unpredictable combinations of form and meaning
* lexicon - dictionary (Greek lexis - word, speech from legein - to say
* morphemes - smallest unpredictable combinations of form and meaning
* free morpheme - morpheme that can stand by itself
* comorpheme - two or more free morphemes combined together
* bound morpheme - morpheme that can't stand by itself

## morpheme parts
* root
* affix
  * prefix
  * infix
  * suffix
  * circumfix (beginning and end) - not in English
* stem - add a new morpheme to the root and it becomes a stem for the next morpheme
  * when adding several affixes, which combinations can act as stems?
  * potential ambiguity
* bound morpheme - important for meaning, but can't stand independently
* fusional morphology - one affix can hold more than one piece of information
* sometimes can use spelling differences instead of using affixes
* suppletion - sometimes can change the word altogether (go and went)
  * mostly with handful of common words instead of a systematic process
* many edge cases and exceptions to define what a word is

## syntax
* The study of how languages express the relationships between words.
* strategies
  * word order (SVO, SOV, VSO)
  * add morpheme (latin, greek, turkish)
  * set up the space
* grammaticality
  * does not refer to making sense
  * does not refer to authority approval
  * ungrammatical - mark with an asterisk *
* idolect
  * unique personal version of language
* tests
  * substitution - substitute single words for several words and preserve meaning
  * cleft - what words can be moved together as a group - It's _____ that _____
  * what clefts are grammatical or ungrammatical?
  * cleft tests used in languages that use word order as part of syntax (like English)
  * cleft tests won't work in languages that use morphemes to denote relationships (like Latin)
* morphosyntax - morphology + syntax
  * cleft construction
  * subject, predicate
  * verbs and objects usually have closer relationship than subject and verb
  * constituents - subgroups in a sentence
* grammar - structural patterns
  * morphemes -> words -> constituents -> sentences
  
CCL #4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1zpnN-6pZQ

## trees
* represent the structural relationships between words
* phrase - less than full sentence, more than single word
  * vp - verb phrase
  * np - noun phrase
  * det - determiners
  * s - sentence
  * n - noun
  * v - verb
  * adj - adjective
  * adv - adverb
  * pn - pronoun
* grammar - description of how sentences go together in a language.
  * s = np + vp
  * np = (d) + n
  * vp = v + (np)
  * pp = p + np
  * ( ) = optional
  * head - required, most important
  * complement - optional, less important
* recursion - build structures iside of other structures
* syntax
  * theories of syntax
* representations
  * trees
  * lexical functional grammar
  * Reed-Kellogg diagrams
  * dependency grammar
  * logical notation
  * some structures don't have a good representation yet

CCL #5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6geQjY8b7sA

## Semantics
* lexicographers
* semantics - meaning and ways to describe it
* definition - clear and concise description of how people are using a word
* semantic relationships
  * synonyms
  * antonym
  * hypernym
  * hyponym
* semantic space
* semantic drift
* euphemisms
* polysemy
* exceptions and edge cases
* alternatives to definitions
  * prototypes or exemplars
  * category members
  * prototype theory - content words
  * function words - described based on relatinship to the words they're used with
* Predicate calculus
  * first-order logic
  * quantificational logic
  * first-order predicate calculus
* formal semantics
  * using formulas
* quantifiers
  * universal - all
  * existential - a
* Binary Feature Analysis - describes words that are part of a taxonomy
* Natural Semantic Metalanguage - words broken down into more basic units of meaning
* Cognitive semantics - metaphors draw connection between abstract concepts and concrete concepts

CCL #6 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPwpk-YgvjQ

## Pragatics - put meaning into context
* Quality
  * High-quality information
* Quantity
  * enough detail, but not too much
* Relevance
  * relevant information
* Manner
  * straightforward manner
* cooperative principle - 4 concepts play into cooperativeness, Grice's maxims
* when literal meaning doesn't make sence, use inference
* Implicature
  * additional meaning of context layered on top of words being said
  * polite
  * sometimes a word or particle
  * hedges
  * indirectness
  * cultural norms of politeness
* turn taking - flow of words between people
* high involvement
  * overlap - high
  * turn order - same time
  * space between turns - none
* high considerateness
  * overlap - none
  * turn order - waits for turn
  * space - a lot
* individual conversation styles and cultural norms
  * differ by culture and region

## Sociolinguistics

* oberver's paradox - language used changes when observed
* code switching - change speech depending who you're talking to
* linguistic discrimination

## Psycholinguistics
* where and how does language acquisition happen in brain
* Broca's aphasia

 * affected away to use morphosyntax
* Wernicke's aphasia
 * can produce fluent sounding language, but it's nonsensical

 * Spoonerisms
 * Tip of the tongue
 * Mixed metaphores
* mapping between senses
* priming experiments
* gating experiments
* eye tracking studies
* garden path sentences
* EEG
 * N400 surges
 * precise about time, not about space
* FMRI
 * brain locations
 * precise about space, not about time

 * diverge
 * pidgin
 * creoles
* Diachronic analysis - looking at change in language over time using written sources

CCL #14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxyo83cQjhI

## World languages
* maybe 7000 languages
* differentiate language - mutual intelligibility, political factors, resources and records
* language vs dialect
 * mutual intelligibility - can understand each other
 * say some things differently but still understand - different dialect
 * can't pinpoint specific change over time
 * dialect chain or dialect continuum - tendency for language to change along a gradient, common
 * diaspora communities
 * larger groups tend to change faster than smaller groups
 * deaf community signed languages, new languages get created
 * identity and politics play a role in what gets counted as a language
 * Hindi and Urdu as mutually intelligible as American and Brittish english, but use different scripts to write and called different because of politics
 * Many chinese dialects not mutually but use same writing system so often called dialects
 * many governments lump dialects together based on how upper-class members speak
 * official dialcects often used to create image of national unity
 * official dialects often taught in preference to regional dialects
 * government policies to repress indivious languages
* language idiologies
* dictionary
 * several trained lexicographers years of work to create one
 * funding
 * some languages have access to a lot more funding than others
* language revitalization
 * language nests
 * learning environments
* linguistic justice
 * rights of children to learn mother tongue
 * fight for visibility of smaller languages
 * don't discriminate against people for the way they speak
 * stop assuming 1-1 relationship between nations and languages
* how many languages vs how help maintain richness of linguistic experience
