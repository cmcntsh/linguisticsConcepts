## Features of language
* duality of patterning - language exists at 2 levels
  * form (individual sounds)
  * signs - combinations of forms (sounds put together to make a word with meaning)
* arbitrariness of the sign
  * distinguish a language from other forms of communication
  * sign - anything that conveys a meaning beyond itself
  * sign can be anything, not necessarily to have specific sound to represent something
  * smell of moisture is a non-arbitrary sign because it is so strongly connected with rain
* displacement
  * past, future, other settings
* reflexivity
  * use language to talk about language
  * meta language
  
## Areas of linguistics
* Phonetics - individual sounds
* Phonology - study of how sounds are combined into patterns
* Morphology - study of internal structure of words
* Syntax - study of how words group together to make sentences
* Semantics - study of meanings of words and sentences
* Pragmatics - meaning in a larger social context
* specific areas
  * sociolinguistics
  * historical linguistics
  * psycholinguistics

CCL #2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93sK4jTGrss

## Morphology - what is a word?
  * predictability
* phrase that has meaning not necessarily clear from looking at definitions of parts alone
* meaning is unpredictable
* lexemes or lexical items - entry or unit - largest unpredictable combinations of form and meaning
* lexicon - dictionary (Greek lexis - word, speech from legein - to say
* morphemes - smallest unpredictable combinations of form and meaning
* free morpheme - morpheme that can stand by itself
* comorpheme - two or more free morphemes combined together
* bound morpheme - morpheme that can't stand by itself

## morpheme parts
* root
* affix
  * prefix
  * infix
  * suffix
  * circumfix (beginning and end) - not in English
* stem - add a new morpheme to the root and it becomes a stem for the next morpheme
  * when adding several affixes, which combinations can act as stems?
  * potential ambiguity
* bound morpheme - important for meaning, but can't stand independently
* fusional morphology - one affix can hold more than one piece of information
* sometimes can use spelling differences instead of using affixes
* suppletion - sometimes can change the word altogether (go and went)
  * mostly with handful of common words instead of a systematic process
* many edge cases and exceptions to define what a word is

CCL #3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1r1grQiLdk

## syntax
* The study of how languages express the relationships between words.
* strategies
  * word order (SVO, SOV, VSO)
  * add morpheme (latin, greek, turkish)
  * set up the space
* grammaticality
  * does not refer to making sense
  * does not refer to authority approval
  * ungrammatical - mark with an asterisk *
* idolect
  * unique personal version of language
* tests
  * substitution - substitute single words for several words and preserve meaning
  * cleft - what words can be moved together as a group - It's _____ that _____
  * what clefts are grammatical or ungrammatical?
  * cleft tests used in languages that use word order as part of syntax (like English)
  * cleft tests won't work in languages that use morphemes to denote relationships (like Latin)
* morphosyntax - morphology + syntax
  * cleft construction
  * subject, predicate
  * verbs and objects usually have closer relationship than subject and verb
  * constituents - subgroups in a sentence
* grammar - structural patterns
  * morphemes -> words -> constituents -> sentences
